The config.txt has the following content:
A 1 1
B 2 1 A
C 3 1 A
D 4 1 B C


yifei@yifei-VirtualBox:~/Downloads/proj3$ ./graph config.txt
Node A computed a value of 1 after 1 second.
Node C computed a value of 3 after 2 second.
Node B computed a value of 2 after 2 second.
Node D computed a value of 4 after 3 second.
